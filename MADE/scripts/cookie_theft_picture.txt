Scene overview
	•	Indoor kitchen scene, line drawing. Three people (an adult woman and two children) are in view.
	•	Perspective is slightly angled, showing the sink/counter along the right wall and upper cabinets along the left/center wall.
	•	It appears to be daytime; an open window above the sink looks out onto a yard/garden.

Right side (sink/window area)
	•	A single-basin sink is overflowing: water is running from the faucet, filling the basin, and pouring over the front edge in a continuous sheet onto the cabinet doors and floor, forming a widening puddle.
	•	The faucet is on; there is no visible plug but the drain is not taking water away.
	•	An adult woman stands in front of the sink, facing left. She is drying or polishing a plate with a dish towel, her attention fixed on the plate.
	•	She wears a knee-length dress and an apron. One foot is already in the puddle of water on the floor, but she shows no reaction—her expression remains neutral and she appears unaware of the overflow.
	•	On the counter to the woman’s right (viewer’s far right) are stacked dishes and bowls.
	•	Above the sink is a wide window with curtains tied back on both sides. The window panes are divided into small squares.
	•	Through the open window, a garden is visible: a path or walkway with low bushes/plants on both sides and a fence or structure further back. The outside appears calm and tidy, contrasting with the interior.

Center–left (cupboard/counter area)
	•	Upper wall cabinet doors are open. Inside the left cabinet is a large jar labeled “COOKIE JAR,” filled with cookies.
	•	A boy is climbing and partially standing on a two-step stool placed on the floor in front of the counter.
	•	The stool’s legs are splayed and tilted; it appears unstable and close to tipping backward.
	•	The boy’s body is stretched upward toward the open cabinet. One hand reaches into the cookie jar; with the other hand he holds a plate—either as a makeshift lid or to catch cookies.
	•	The counter below the cabinet is clear, providing space for him to climb. The open cabinet doors and edges frame his figure.

Far left (near wall)
	•	A girl stands on the floor near the boy, facing him and the cabinet.
	•	She has one arm raised toward the jar, palm open, as if asking for or anticipating a cookie.
	•	Her posture is attentive and expectant; she is not touching the stool but is clearly cooperating in the act.

Objects and details
	•	Kitchen cabinets (lower) have simple doors with pulls; the overflow water streams down their fronts.
	•	Dishes are present both near the sink (to the right) and in the woman’s hands.
	•	The dish towel is bunched around the plate she is drying.
	•	Light from the window emphasizes the ordinary domestic setting despite the hazards inside.

Actions and relationships
	•	The woman is absorbed in drying dishes and not noticing:
	•	the running water overflowing the sink,
	•	the growing puddle at her feet,
	•	the children’s risky behavior behind/left of her.
	•	The boy is actively taking cookies from the jar while precariously balanced on a tipping stool.
	•	The girl is cooperating or waiting to receive a cookie, reaching upward toward the boy/jar.

Risks/implications
	•	Immediate hazards include:
	•	The stool may tip, causing the boy to fall.
	•	The floor is wet and slippery; the woman or children could slip.
	•	Water damage to cabinets and floor; possible broken dishes if someone falls.
	•	Social rule being broken: the children are secretly taking cookies without the adult’s awareness.

Overall composition
	•	The drawing contrasts calm, routine dishwashing (adult) with unnoticed hazards and mischief (children).
	•	The open window and tidy garden outside emphasize normalcy, while the interior shows impending accidents (overflow, unstable stool, secretive cookie theft).
